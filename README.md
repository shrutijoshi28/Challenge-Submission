Project Title

Take a second to imagine that you are in a room with 100 chairs arranged in a circle. 
These chairs are numbered sequentially from One to One Hundred. 
At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be told to leave the room. 
The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be told to leave. 
Next to go is person in chair #6. In other words, 1 person will be skipped initially, and then 2, 3, 4.. and so on. 
This pattern of skipping will keep going around the circle until there is only one person remaining- The survivor! 
Note that each chair is removed when the person leaves the room.

Note that the number of the chair does not change when chairs are removed. Essentially each chair has a unique and permanent ID that is assigned when the "chairs" are put in the room in the first place.

Write a function that will determine, for N chairs, which chair is the "survivor" by having the function return the number of the surviving chair.
